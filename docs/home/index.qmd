Jonathan Millar is a Senior Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh and an Honorary Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth II University Hospital, Glasgow. 

His research interests include the functional genomics of ARDS, computational biology applied to the lung, and lung model systems (precision cut lung slices, *ex-vivo* lung perfusion, and complex large animal models).

He completed his PhD with Prof John Fraser (University of Queensland) and Prof Danny McAuley (Queenâ€™s University Belfast), studying the role of mesenchymal stem cells and ECMO in ARDS.

Since moving to Edinburgh in 2020, he has worked with Prof Kenneth Baillie at the Roslin Institute and the Baillie Gifford Pandemic Science Hub. 

He has contributed to the Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) study and is working to develop *in-silico* and *in-vitro* platforms to better understand the functional genomics underpinning acute severe respiratory failure.

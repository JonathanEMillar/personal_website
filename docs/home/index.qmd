**Senior Clinical Research Fellow & Honorary Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine** 

The University of Edinburgh and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow

:::

<br/>

My research interests include computational biology applied to the lung, the integration of deep-learning and clinical trials, and the functional genomics of ARDS.

I completed my PhD with Prof John Fraser and Prof Danny McAuley, studying the role of mesenchymal stem cells and ECMO in ARDS.

Since moving to Edinburgh in 2020, I have worked with Prof Kenneth Baillie at the Baillie-Gifford Pandemic Science Hub, Institute of Regeneration & Repair. 

I have contributed to the Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) study and am working to develop *in-silico* and *in-vitro* platforms to better understand the functional genomics of ARDS and to discover novel treatments.
